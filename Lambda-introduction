Today we are going to learn the fundamentals of Serverless architecture. also we will understand the difference between Ec2 and Lambda functions? 
Also we will understand when should we use ec2 and ehen should we use lambda functions. as a devops engineer we have both choices, we can use ec2 and lambda as well?

1) What is lambda and what problem it will solve ?
   When we discuss lambda we should remain two primary things.
   1) Compute 2) Serverless.
   Lambda funtions are belongs to the compute family but it solve the problem of serverless.
   It belongs to same family which ec2 belongs too. but the primary difference between using ec2 and using lambda function follow the serverless architecture.
   That means if you are spinningup a lambda function like you are going to aws console and create a lambda function aws will taking care of the server depends on appliction which we are running.
